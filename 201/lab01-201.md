# HTML STRUCTURE
**How HTML  Describe theStructure of Pages?**
Let's look closer at the code from the following image.
There are several different elements. Each
element has an opening tag and a closing tag

Tags act like containers. They tell you
something about the information that lies
between their opening and closing tags.


&nbsp;

**Why we use attributes in the HTML tags?**

Attributes provide additional information
about the contents of an element. They appear
on the opening tag of the element and are
made up of two parts: a name and a value,
separated by an equals sign. look at the following image

The attribute name indicates
what kind of extra information
you are supplying about the
element's content. It should be
written in lowercase.
The value is the information
or setting for the attribute. It
should be placed in double
quotes. Different attributes can
have different values.

# The process of making a website
&nbsp;
Making a website is a project contains many interelated processes that should be done in a specific order , now i am going to show you* some processes you should follow in order to make a successful website . First, specify your target audience for example , your website will be directed to women or men , will be directed to people live in city or in rural area..etc. second, identify the type of services you offer in the website ,Now that you know who your visitors are, you need to consider why they are coming. While some people will simply chance across your website, most will visit for a specific reason. third,you need to specify the kind of information your visitors are looking for ,You know who is coming to your site and why they are coming, so now you need to work out what information they need in order to achieve their goals quickly and effectively. after that, you need to set up a site map for you website,Now that you know what needs to appearon your site, you can start to organize. look at the picture below to see an example of a site map site map the information into sections or pages. fifth,Visual hierarchy in which Most web users do not read entire pages. Rather, they skim to findinformation. You can use contrast. to create a visual hierarchy that gets across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for. last but not least , grouping and Similarity ,When making sense of a design, we tend to organize visual elements into groups. Grouping related pieces of information together can make a design easier to comprehend. Here are some ways this can be achieved.

# HTML5 LAYOUT
HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already. It is worth to mention that HTML5 has many elements , the most important of which are:

- The header and footer elements
- The navigation element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.
- The article element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated
- The section element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.
- Heading groups element , The section element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.
 # EXTRA MARKUP
HTML main structure contains the following elements such as:

- doCtypes (!DOCTYPE html)
- comments using !–comments –
- paragraph using p /p
- header using h1 to hi depend on the font size

# using javascript in HTML
*using JS in HTML allows the programmer to do such an amazing work in his web page structure, you can simply think of HTML as skeleton of a human body and JS in this case is like the skin that cover every thing and make it more beautiful and relaiable. Here is some specific things that JS can allow you to do in your project:*

- Js allows you to make the web pages mmore interactive by accessing and modifying the content
- JS allows you to specify a set of rules that a browser should follow. For example you can add a mortgage calculator to collect values from forms and perform a calculations
- using Js to specify that some scripts should done when a specific events have occurred.
## Examples of JS in the browser
Being able to change the content of an HTML page while it is loaded in the browser is very powerful. Such as:

- **Slide shows:** Slideshows can display a number of different images(or other HTML content) within the same space on a given page. They can play automatically as a sequence, or users can click through the slides manually. They allow more content to be displayed within a limited amount of space.
- **Forms:** Validating forms (checking whether they have been filled in correctly) is important when information is supplied by users. JavaScript lets you alert the user if mistakes have been made. It can also perform sophisticated calculations based on any data entered and reveal the results to the user
# ARITHMETIC OPERATORS in JS
JavaScript contains the following mathematical operators, which you can use with numbers.

- **mathmatical operators :** Several arithmetic operations can be performed in oneexpression, but it is important to understand how the result will be calculated. Multiplication and division are performed before addition or subtraction. This can affect the number that you expect to see. To illustratethis effect, look at the following examples. To change the order in which operations are performed, place the calculation you want done first inside parentheses. So for the following, the total is 60: total = (2 + 4) * 10; The parentheses indicate that the 2 is added to the 4, and then the resulting figure is multiplied by10.
- **STRING OPERATOR :** There are many occasions whereyou may need to join two or more strings to create a singlevalue. Programmers call the process of joining together two or more strings to create one new string concatenation. For example, you might have a first and last name in two separate variables and want to join them to show a full name. In this example, the variable called full Name would hold the string ‘Ivy Stone’. var firstName = ‘Ivy ‘ ; var lastName = ‘ Stone’ ; var ful l Name = f irstName + l astName ;
