# project  Aristotle
Studies have found that teams are more productive than individuals working by themselves and that good teamwork can lead to product innovation, better results, and higher job satisfaction.The story of this project start when 25 years old girl called Julia Rozovsky decided to quit her job in a consultant firm and try to find more social job , in which she can interact with other people , sharing knowledge and devices.
so she decided to enroll to MPA course that mainly depend on studing business and finding solutions for the main business problems with help of a team . At first she assigned to work with a team ans she thought that the team work would be more effective and productive , but after period she realize that if she worked alone would be better than working with this kind of group for some reasons such as every member of that team was trying to prove himself rather than listening to another and learn from them also when they meet , they are trying to criticize other people outside the team rather than focus on the actual work so she finally decided to leave the team and enter another one.
when she entered the second group she changed her mind about team working , surprisingly this group was more productive and hard working even though each one of team member came from different background .
At this point Julia Rozovsky start asking herself questions about way the second team was more productive and which kind of things will be responsible for the team work success.

After graduation from university , with MPA degree she start working at google , at that period google was decided to build the most effective team ever , so the researches was conducted and the Aristotle project start to in order to figure what the reasons that responsible for make a team more success productive than individual.

The first results of the project showed that actually there is no clear pattern or something in commom that should be exist inside the group to make it effective . For example , sharing the team members the same interests , hoppies and background knowledge do not warranty the success of that group . 

After sometimes , the researches and Julia Rozovsky came up with a solution of that dilemma and they figure out that in order for the team to be success and productive it should has some kind of behaviors of rules covers all the team work . which are:

 - **Psychological safety**: Psychological safety refers to an individual’s perception of the consequences of taking an interpersonal risk or a belief that a team is safe for risk taking in the face of being seen as ignorant, incompetent, negative, or disruptive. In a team with high psychological safety, teammates feel safe to take risks around their team members. They feel confident that no one on the team will embarrass or punish anyone else for admitting a mistake, asking a question, or offering a new idea.

 - **Dependability**: On dependable teams, members reliably complete quality work on time


 - **Structure and clarity**: An individual’s understanding of job expectations, the process for fulfilling these expectations, and the consequences of one’s performance are important for team effectiveness. Goals can be set at the individual or group level, and must be specific, challenging, and attainable. Google often uses Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) to help set and communicate short and long term goals.


 - **Meaning**: Finding a sense of purpose in either the work itself or the output is important for team effectiveness. The meaning of work is personal and can vary: financial security, supporting family, helping the team succeed, or self-expression for each individual, for example.


 - **impact**:
 Seeing that one’s work is contributing to the organization’s goals can help reveal impact.
