# THE PAST, PRESENT & FUTURE OF LOCAL STORAGE FOR WEB APPLICATIONS


Local storage mainly is an ability to store information locally in the browser such as chrome. local storage can hold from two up to a hundred megabytes or more of
data this data has to be saved in astring form and so JSON is one of the

most common formats to use for saving data depending on the project we're working on this may be useful for web interface data such as saving different parts of the page and their statuses or displays depending on what is going on
also it can be helpful for temporary or
offline storage for content from a site or an app in using JavaScript with local
storage we have the ability to read
write and delete data from local storage . by default when working with JavaScript
we have a local storage object this will
let us set items get items and remove
items


### Note that The localStorage object stores data with no expiration date. The data will not be deleted when the browser is closed, and will be available the next day, week, or year.
