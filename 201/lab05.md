# images 
as a website maker , there are many reason that make you insert images into your website , for example you may add some graphics for illustrating purpose or add some pictures that describe the products you want to sell.Here is some information from me that will help you if you want to add some pictures in your website:

- The location of the picture should be specified according to some rules and not in arbitrary way. As following:

1- before a paragraph

2- Inside the start of the paragraph

3- In the middle of the paraghraph

- To add image you need to use the(img) tag and specify some attributes inside that tag , which are:

1- Source attribute(scr) which specify the path of the images ( it can be absolute URL or relative URl)

2-Alternative attribute (alt): This provides a text description
of the image which describes the
image if you cannot see it.

3- title attribute ( title) to add some extra information about the image.

4-Also you can simply specify the width and hight of the image by adding width and hight attribute inside the (img) tag.


5- you can also add ( align) attribute to align the image in any direction you want . for example if you use (align left) the image will place on the left and the entire paragraph will be in the right beside the image .

- Do forget to identify the followind three things when you add an image:

1-*saving the image in an appropriate format like jpeg, gif, or png*
2- *saving the image at the right size(width and hight)*

3-*Use the correct
resolution:*
Computer screens are made up
of dots known as pixels. Images
used on the web are also made
up of tiny dots. Resolution refers
to the number of dots per inch,
and most computer screens only
show web pages at 72 pixels
per inch. So saving images at
a higher resolution results in
images that are larger than
necessary and take longer to
download.

# color
in addition to the images , adding color to your website make it more attractive and easier to use.nearly every part of the website it's color can be changed for example , the color of the text itself , the background color of the text or even the background color of the entire page.

### Note that color can be added alone for intance you can specify the color of the text by re only , or it can be added as a mix of color which called *color code* for example the **rgb** code which stands for red , green and blue . you can specify the percent of each one of these three colors to make your own color.

### In addtion to the color itself , you can also specify some features related to it . for example you can specify the saturation of the color to make it either deeper or lighter , also you can specify the opacity of the color by adding **a** to **rgb** to be **rgba**.


# Text
CSS allow you to add some features to the text to make iy more attractive and arrangment . here are a number of things that you can add to the text:

- change the text type by using the **font-family** propert 

- change the text size by using the **text-font** property ( you can specify it either in pixel or as a percentage of the default value which is 
16px)

- Make the font **BOLD** in case it is an important text by using the **font-weight** property

- Make the text *italic* . sometimes if you have some text like a univarsity name you have to make it *italic* by using the **font-style** property

- changing the position of the text by using the **text-align** property
