# coding and women
There are far fewer women around the world who are interested in studying computer science or who specialize in computer science than men. 
The reason for this may be because home computers made in the 1970s and 1980s were almost technically free and contained a number of toys that were intended for children and men, so this has made a lot of people think that computers are only for men.  

# Diversity in tech
Many studies on many successful companies operating in various fields such as industry, accounting, technical, banking and others have shown that the constituent teams of these companies consisted of different backgrounds.
The diversity of the intellectual and ethnic backgrounds of the team's constituents does not necessarily ensure the success of the project they are working on, but at least there are a lot of positives that diversity brings:
Increasing intellectual productivity as different intellectual backgrounds of people lead to the production of more successful ideas and more effective solutions to problems 

Diversity may also ensure the company increases its customer base. 
For example, if the sales team consists of people from three continents: America, Africa and Asia, the likelihood of satisfying customers on all these continents is greater because the African team member knows exactly what might satisfy customers in Africa and so on.
