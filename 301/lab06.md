# Node.js
Node.js is an open sourse , back-end JavaScript run-time environment that runs on the V8 engine and execute JavaScript code outside a web browser.Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.This means that Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime. In the other word Node.js allow you to run and see the results of your code using terminal instead of live server.

### What does V8 engine mean?
The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.

## npm
Node comes bundled with a package manager called npm .npm is the world's largest Software Registry.The registry contains over 800,000 code packages.Open-source developers use npm to share software. Many organizations also use npm to manage private development.

# What Is Node.js Used For?
installing (via npm) and running (via Node) various build tools — designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.They can be used for anything from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking. In addition developing apps with any modern JavaScript framework (for example, React or Angular) needs a solid knowledge in Node.js

# Advantages of using Node.js
As i mentioned before it allow you to run the code using terminal .Another of Node’s big pluses is that it speaks JSON. JSON is probably the most important data exchange format on the Web, and the lingua franca for interacting with object databases (such as MongoDB). JSON is ideally suited for consumption by a JavaScript program, meaning that when you’re working with Node, data can flow neatly between layers without the need for reformatting. You can have one syntax from browser to server to database.
