# Rest 

what is a protocol?

- it is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It's the foundation of the web.

- You can think of it like GPS coordinates for knowledge and information.

- The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called “REST”.

- REST provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to.

- A web page is a “representation” of a resource.

URLs tell the browser that there's a concept somewhere.

- A browser can then go ask for a specific representation of the concept.

- “Web Services” or "APIs":is that machines could use the web just like people do.

which means computers can use those same protocols to send messages back and forth to each other.
- redirect:is a technique for moving visitors to a different Web page than the one they request, usually because the page requested is unavailable.

- polymorphism: can be applied to many different nouns. Some verbs are more specific than others and apply only to a small set of nouns.

But some verbs are almost universal like GET, PUT, and DELETE.
HTTP is all about applying verbs to nouns.

- the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you type in and back comes a web page.
is actually a general purpose protocol for applying verbs to nouns.
- HTTP POST:to add something to another system.
- HTTP PUT:to replace something in another system or to do a partial update.
software developers work on now to Decide how to best model the data thanks almost entirely to RESTful web frameworks like Ruby on Rails.
