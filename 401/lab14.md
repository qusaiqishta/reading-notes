# Matplotlib

matplotlib is probably the single most used Python package for 2D-graphics. It provides both a very quick way to visualize data from Python and publication-quality figures in many formats. We are going to explore matplotlib in interactive mode covering most common cases

Example:draw the cosine and sine functions on the same plot.

```
import numpy as np

X = np.linspace(-np.pi, np.pi, 256, endpoint=True)
C, S = np.cos(X), np.sin(X)

```

You can custumized the figure , for example , we want to have the cosine in blue and the sine in red and a slightly thicker line for both of them. We'll also slightly alter the figure size to make it more horizontal.

```
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6), dpi=80)
plt.plot(X, C, color="blue", linewidth=2.5, linestyle="-")
plt.plot(X, S, color="red",  linewidth=2.5, linestyle="-")


```

Ticks are now properly placed but their label is not very explicit. We could guess that 3.142 is Ï€ but it would be better to make it explicit. When we set tick values, we can also provide a corresponding label in the second argument list. Note that we'll use latex to allow for nice rendering of the label.

```
plt.xticks([-np.pi, -np.pi/2, 0, np.pi/2, np.pi],
       [r'$-\pi$', r'$-\pi/2$', r'$0$', r'$+\pi/2$', r'$+\pi$'])

plt.yticks([-1, 0, +1],
       [r'$-1$', r'$0$', r'$+1$'])

```

### You can also add a legend to the figure

```
plt.plot(X, C, color="blue", linewidth=2.5, linestyle="-", label="cosine")
plt.plot(X, S, color="red",  linewidth=2.5, linestyle="-", label="sine")

plt.legend(loc='upper left', frameon=False)

```
