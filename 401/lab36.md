## The code I’m still ashamed of - article review 


The article talks about the story of a programmer working in a company that works in information technology stores, as one day he was asked to build a website for a company that manufactures medicines, as this site is mainly based on asking several questions to a user and then recommending a specific drug for that user
It is worth noting that the criterion requested by the owner of the site, on which the process of recommending the drug to the user is based, was invalid and its main goal is to increase profits and sell certain types of drugs, as no matter how the user’s answers to the questions asked by the website change, the answer will be fixed and this is what led To the death of a girl after she used this website to find out the appropriate medication for her disease, as the site had recommended a medication that was not appropriate for her disease condition.
 From this, the lesson must be taken and the understanding that the programmer has a great responsibility for what he does, as he must know the results well that will result when building if he designs a particular website.

## Self Driving Car Ethics - article review
 The article talks about the self-driving car and raises a very important ethical question, which is that if there is a person inside a self-driving car traveling on a public road and suddenly a school full of students appears in front of it, what is the decision that the car will take in that case, will it drive itself side by side? Or will you let the bus crash into the trees and endanger the lives of many students? Who is more important for the car, the life of one person inside or the lives of many people outside??
Here lies a great moral responsibility on the shoulders of the people who program these cars to make them take decisions that will lead to the least damage and human losses.
