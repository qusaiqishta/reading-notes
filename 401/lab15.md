# Trees

Node - A Tree node is a component which may contain itâ€™s own values, and references to other nodes
Root - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree
K - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.
Left - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree
Right - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree
Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not have any children
Height - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf

## Traversals

- Depth First

Depth first traversal is where we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first. There are multiple ways to carry out depth first traversal, and each method changes the order in which we search/print the root. Here are three methods for depth first traversal:

Pre-order: root >> left >> right

In-order: left >> root >> right

Post-order: left >> right >> root

Pre-order: A, B, D, E, C, F

In-order: D, B, E, A, F, C

Post-order: D, E, B, F, C, A


## Binary Tree Vs K-ary Trees

- Binary Trees restrict the number of children to two (hence our left and right children).

- K-ary trees: when node carry more than two childs
and k refers to the max number of children that each node is able to have


# Binary Search Trees
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a type of tree that does have some structure attached to it. In a BST, nodes are organized in a manner where all values that are smaller than the root are placed to the left, and all values that are larger than the root are placed to the right.
