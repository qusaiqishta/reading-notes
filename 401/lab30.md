# WhiteBoard Interview Tips

## Communicate 
- if you have a question in your mind that it's answer will makes you inderstand the code challenge clearly , do not hesitate to ask!

## Restate the Question
- make sure to show the interviwer that you are completely understand the your solution by doing verification

## Ask About Edge Cases

- It’s still not time to dive right into coding the solution. Think for a bit about the inputs and expected output and think about potential edge cases to the problem. Ask about them. In many cases, the interviewer hasn’t even thought about edge cases and will make something up. That’s great — it shows you’re analytical and will work hard to try to prevent bugs (which often crop up due to edge cases).

## Ask About Test Cases
- This is free and you should take advantage of it. Simply ask if there are any test cases that the function should pass. Your interviewer might be expecting you to ask this question, so it might be necessary. But it’s also possible the interviewer was not expecting the question and will think “ah, this candidate knows about testing!”

## Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense

## Write the Actual Code and Ask if it Looks Good
- You should now convert your pseudocode into actual code. You don’t even need to remove the comments. At this point, you just need to plug the appropriate code for your language in. If you forget some syntax or a method name, you should be able to ask your interviewer for this information without too much grief. If they give you trouble, just say you’ll leave it as pseudocode for now.

## If you getting stuck at any point , simply ask for help

## Come prepared.
- When it comes to programming interviews, there is no substitute for HOBIS (which stands for Hours of Butt-In-Seat). If you want to be ready, you have to put in the time. It’s important in order to maximize your chances of acing the interview, but it’s also important for your peace of mind during the interview and afterwards. In the interview, knowing that you’ve done all you can to prepare helps you stay calm and cool, and increases your chances of success. And afterwards, regardless of the outcome, knowing that you could not have reasonably done more to prepare helps you feel proud of your work and start moving towards your next goal.
To pretty much everyone that I coach through interviews, I recommend the same personal interview prep bible: Cracking the Coding Interview, by Gail Laakman McDowell. Like myself, Gail’s been at Facebook and Google, but as a former member of the Google Hiring Committee, Gail is qualified to speak authoritatively on the software hiring process (and able to speak in detail about the Google hiring process, which I cannot due to my employment contract). This book’s been around for years and almost every engineer I’ve met at Google or Facebook (including myself) has completed it cover-to-cover. If you want to get the most value out of your HOBIS, I cannot recommend CtCI enough.
No matter what material you use, make sure you get enough HOBIS and your next interview will be a much better experience.
