# Why using CSS is important when launching a website
CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. For example, you can specify that
the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one
headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.
# What CSS allows you to do with your HTML page?
- Boxes:
Width and height
Borders (color, width, and style)
Background color and images
Position in the browser window.
-Text:
Typeface
Size
Color
Italics, bold, uppercase,
lowercase, small-caps
- Specific:
There are also specific ways
in which you can style certain
elements such as lists, tables,
and forms.

# There are two ways to link CSS file with the HTML file:
- **first:Using External CSS**
The <link> element can be used
in an HTML document to tell the
browser where to find the CSS
file used to style the page. It is an
empty element (meaning it does
not need a closing tag), and it
lives inside the <head> element.
It should use three attributes:
*advantages of using external CSS file summerized by:
 - Allows all pages to use the
same style rules (rather than
repeating them in each page).
- Keeps the content separate
from how the page looks.
- Means you can change the
styles used across all pages
by altering just one file
(rather than each individual
page).
- **second:Using Internal CSS**
You can also include CSS rules
within an HTML page by placing
them inside a <style> element,
which usually sits inside the
<head> element of the page.

# What is a Function and why we use it inside a HTML code?
**Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements)**

# How functions work?
1-The program comes to a line of code containing a "function call".
2-The program enters the function (starts at the first line in the function code).
3-All instructions inside of the function are executed from top to bottom.
4-The program leaves the function and goes back to where it started from.
5-Any data computed and RETURNED by the function is used in place of the function in the original line of code.
