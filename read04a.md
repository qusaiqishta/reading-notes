# using javascript in HTML
*using JS in HTML allows the programmer to do such an amazing work in his web page structure, you can simply think of HTML as skeleton of a human body and JS in this case is like the skin that cover every thing and make it more beautiful and relaiable.
Here is some specific things that JS can allow you to do in your project:*
- Js allows you to make the web pages mmore interactive by accessing and modifying the content
- JS allows you to specify a set of rules that a browser should follow. For example you can add a mortgage calculator to collect values from forms and perform a calculations 
- using Js to specify that some scripts should done when a specific events have occurred.
# Examples of JS in the browser
Being able to change the content of an HTML page while it is loaded in the browser is very powerful. Such as:
- **Slide shows**:
Slideshows can display a number of different images(or other HTML content) within the same space on a given page. They can play automatically as a sequence, or users can click through the slides manually. They allow more content to be displayed
within a limited amount of space. 
- **Forms**:
Validating forms (checking whether they have been filled in correctly) is important when information is supplied by users. JavaScript lets you alert the user if mistakes have been made. It can also perform sophisticated calculations based on any data entered
and reveal the results to the user


# ARITHMETI  OPERATORS in JS
JavaScript contains the following mathematical operators, which you can use with numbers.
- mathmatical operators :
Several arithmetic operations can be performed in oneexpression, but it is important to understand how the result will be calculated. Multiplication and division are performed before addition or subtraction. This can affect the number that you expect to see. To illustratethis effect, look at the following examples. 
To change the order in which operations are performed, place the calculation you want done first inside parentheses. So for
the following, the total is 60: total = (2 + 4) * 10; The parentheses indicate that the 2 is added to the 4, and then the resulting figure is multiplied by10. 
- STRING OPERATOR :
There are many occasions whereyou may need to join two or more strings to create a singlevalue. Programmers call the process of joining together two or more strings to create one new string concatenation. For example, you might have a first and last name in two separate
variables and want to join them to show a full name. In this example, the variable called full Name would hold the string 'Ivy Stone'.
var firstName = 'Ivy ' ;
var lastName = ' Stone' ;
var ful l Name = f irstName + l astName ;
